Please complete any 2 of the following:

- Create a web page that prints all of the lyrics to '99 bottles of beer' https://www.songfacts.com/lyrics/traditional/99-bottles-of-beer

- Take the previously created Rock Paper Scissors application and allow the user to play 3 times.

Bonus: The game should stop if the user wins

Bonus: The computer should change their guess each time

- Create a web page that asks a user how many subjects they take, and what marks they got in each subject. The application should then output their results

Bonus: Tell the user their grade from A-F based on their results

Please commit your attempts to GitHub, and then upload a link here.
